# Search Heuristic for the Simplified Traffic Light Problem

Parallel implementation of the scatter search metaheuristic for the NP-Hard Traffic Light Problem.

In this repository you'll find parallel and sequential versions of the Scatter Search metaheuristic as well as a sequential implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for comparison purposes only.

The paper detaling the work and the results is available in this repository [in portuguese](https://github.com/rockerbacon/traffic-light-search-heuristic/blob/master/paper_pt_br.pdf). An english translation is currently a work in progress.

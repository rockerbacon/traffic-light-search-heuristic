# Search Heuristic for the Simplified Traffic Light Problem

Parallel implementation of the scatter search metaheuristic for the NP-Hard Traffic Light Problem as described in [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244404904_The_Model_and_Properties_of_the_Traffic_Light_Problem).

In this repository you'll find parallel and sequential versions of the Scatter Search metaheuristic as well as a sequential implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for comparison purposes only.

An article describing the development proccess and results is still a work-in-progress.

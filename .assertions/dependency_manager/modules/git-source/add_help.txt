Help:
Add dependencies to the source files of git repositories which use the Assertions C++ Framework. Branch 'master' is always the one used during installation

Usage: ./dependencies.sh add git GIT_URL [GIT_COMMIT]

GIT_URL: HTTP URL used to clone git repositories. SSH URLs are not acceptable, since SSH may not be configured in every developer environment
GIT_COMMIT: git commit to use, may be a git tag. If not specified, the lastest commit will be used.
	IMPORTANT: the commit will be frozen, meaning all dependency installations will always use the same version. This is true even if the commit is not specified
